    \rThe RUQ is the most sensitive region for free- fluid accumulation surrounding the liver and the right kidney, and in the hepatorenal recess, called Morison's pouch. This view is also used to detect free fluid between the pleural space on the right side.
    \rWhen viewing the Right Upper Quadrant, the probe indicator should be pointing cephalad on the patients right mid-axillary side.
    
    \rThese are the visible areas of focus:
    \r1. Hepatorenal Recess - Morison's Pouch
    \r2. Inferior hepatic edge/inferior pole of the kidney
    \r3. The diaphragm
    \r4. Pleural Space
    
    \rTechnique:
    \rProbe Indicator: Cephalad (points cranially).
    \rIn this view, the liver is easily seen. The diaphragm, slightly more difficult to identify. If you are unable to identify the diaphragm, have the patient take a breath or wait for inspiration as the diaphragm should lower into view.
    
    \rSometimes rib shadows can obstruct the view. Widely fan through the field and follow the lower edge of the liver down toward the posterior until there is a good view of the tip. If there is free fluid (jet black) in Morison's pouch, it should be seen around the lower edge and tip of the liver.

    \rThe LUQ a.k.a the perisplenic, or splenorenal view is used to visualize the presence of free-fluid surrounding the spleen (splenorenal recess a.k.a, Koller's pouch) and in left pleural space around the costophrenic angle.
    \rIt's technically challenging and less sensitive for free-fluid than the RUQ due to the spleen being smaller to identify compared to the liver, the acoustic window being lessened due to obstruction from the stomach and the clinician having to reach across the patient.
    
    \rThe traditional acoustic windows obtained in the LUQ are:
    \r1. Splenorenal Interface
    \r2. Inferior tip of the spleen
    \r3. The diaphragm, above and below
    \r4. Inferior Pole of the Left Kidney
    
    \rTechnique:
    \rProbe Indicator: More cephalad (points cranially) and posterior.
    \rStart midaxillary around the 8th ICS sweeping anterior to posterior until the splenorenal interface is identified. If there is difficulty visualizing the acoustic window, it may be because the transducer is not posterior or superior enough. Once the spleen/kidney is located fan the probe in all directions to evaluate the area.
    
    \rIn a routine scan, the spleen, and left kidney are tightly juxtaposed separated by a hyperechoic line. The echogenic line just cephalad to the spleen is the diaphragm.
    \rIf there is free fluid accumulation, it is more likely to be found in the subphrenic space (between the spleen and diaphragm). Pleural effusions will appear as an anechoic (jet black) stripe or triangle just superior to the diaphragm.

    \rThe cardiac view is used to detect circumferential free fluid around the pericardial sac, free fluid between the RV and liver, and to identify cardiac tamponade. It can be separated into three separate views:
    \rThe traditional cardiac acoustic windows obtained are:
    \r1. Subxyphoid
    \r2. Parasternal Long Axis (PLAX)
    \r3. Parasternal Short Axis (PSAX)
    
    As it's usually sufficient to evaluate one view to check for the presence of pericardial effusions, it's essential to learn all in the event one view is not easily obtained.
    \rTechnique:
    \rProbe Indicator: Probe indicator points towards the left side of the patient.
    \rStart inferiorly to the xiphoid process and place the probe in the transverse axis parallel to the abdominal wall. Firmly plunge the probe slightly under the ribs until the cardiac silhouette comes into view.
    
    \rIn a routine scan, the four chambers of the heart, and the pericardial sac should be visible. The pericardium is hyperechoic. The sonographer should be able to appreciate these eight landmarks. 1. Liver 2. Right Atrium 3. Left Atrium 4. Mitral Valve 5. Left Ventricle 6. Right Ventricle 7. Ventricular septum and 8. Tricuspid valve.

In most cases, the anterior window should be able to rule out a pneumothorax but does not exclude the possibility of smaller pneumothoraces.
    
    \rThe traditional cardiac acoustic windows obtained are:
    \r1. Anterior Chest.
    \r2. Lateral Chest Wall.
    \r3. Costophrenic Angle.
    
    \rTechnique:
    \rProbe Indicator: Indicator facing cephalad.
    \rBegin with the transducer over the 3rd or 4th ICS, midclavicular. The depth should be shallow initially to evaluate lung sliding, and approx. 13-15 cm deep for the rest of the exam. The sonographer should immediately be able to identify at least two ribs and the pleural line.
    \rIn a typical scan, A-line lines, lung sliding, and the presence of the "bat wing" sign should be immediately visible. The body of the bat should represent the pleural line, and the wings serve as the two adjacent ribs. To observe lung sliding, use the M-mode.
    \rA-Lines: These horizontal artifactual lines are produced by a reflection and duplication of the pleural line which is parallel, deep and equidistant from the pleural line which represents normal aeration of the lung. Usually seen in normal "dry."

    The pelvis is the most dependent part of the peritoneal space and the most likely place to appreciate free fluid. The pelvic view is used to evaluate free fluid around the bladder and the pouch of Douglas. Although it is essential for the bladder to be filled in order to fully evaluate the pelvis, with an empty bladder, it is harder to detect free fluid. Also, try to get an image before a Foley catheter is placed.
    
    \rTechnique:
    \rProbe Indicator: 2 Views: Longitudinal (Cephalad) and Transverse (to the patients right).
    
    \rBegin with the probe midline in the abdomen and approx. 2 cm above the symphysis pubis with the indicator pointing cephalad. Scan the pelvic region until the bladder comes into view. It is easily identifiable due to the anechoic urine in the bladder. Sweep the entire bladder and look everywhere as free fluid can collect anywhere in the pelvis.
    
    \rRotate the probe 90 degrees transverse and sweep left to right. In males, free fluid usually will collect in the rectovesical pouch (between the bladder and prostate). In females, in the pelvic Cul de Sac (posterior to the uterus in females).
    \rSometimes, seminal fluid can be mistaken for free fluid in males. In females, ovarian cysts, fibroids and physiological fluid such as menstruation and infection can be mistaken as well.

Increasing intrapericardial pressure leads to increased pressure on the RV which restricts RV filling - followed by decreased LV filling and stroke volume.
    
    \r3) Cardiac Tamponade: Defined when pericardial effusion pressure exceeds atrial and ventricular pressures, coupled with a dilated IVC (which overall inhibits cardiac filling). Although considered a late finding, the clinician will also see septal bowing or flattening towards the LV.
