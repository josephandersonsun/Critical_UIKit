				<string>The pH measures hydrogen ions (H +) in the blood and is inversely proportional to the actual hydrogen ion concentration. Hence, as the hydrogen ion concentration decreases, the pH increases, and vice versa. The pH of blood is usually between 7.35 - 7.45. A pH of less than 7.0 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7.0 is called basic (alkaline), so blood is slightly basic. A normal physiological pH usually is around 7.4.

				<string>SV</string>
				<key>longdescription</key>
				<string>The stroke volume is the amount of blood in mL&apos;s ejected from the LV. Typically, approximately two–thirds of the blood in the left ventricle is pumped out during one ventricular contraction. Coupled with the heart rate in a one minute cycle, we refer to this as the ventricular &quot;stroke volume. (SV)&quot; The SV is estimated by subtracting the end-diastolic volume (EDV) and the end-systolic volume (ESV). SV= EDV - ESV. The EDV simply the amount of blood filled in the LV prior to systole, and the ESV is the extra volume of blood remaining in the ventricle after systole. In a normal heart, the EDV is approx. 120 mL of blood and the ESV about 50 mL of blood. The difference in these two (EDV-ESV) is, 70 mL, which represents the SV. Therefore, any factor that alters either the EDV or the ESV will change SV. For example, an increase in EDV will overall improve the SV, whereas an increase in ESV will reduce the overall SV.</string>

				<string>Troponin is the most specific and sensitive cardiac marker for the detection of myocardial cell injury. 

Troponin I is one of the three regulatory proteins that is distinguished from skeletal injury and is specific for myocardial infarction. Troponin is not typically detected in healthy people but tends to increase significantly after STEMI&apos;s as early as 2 to 3 hours after myocardial damage. Thus, troponins are particularly valuable when there is clinical suspicion of skeletal muscle injury or MI that may be below the detection limit for creatine phosphokinase (CK) and its MB isoenzyme (CK-MB). 

Troponin levels that are greater than 0.4 ng/ mL should be concerning for myocardial infarction. It should be noted that troponins can stay elevated for several days after ST-elevation Myocardial Infarctions.</string>

				<string>Myoglobin is a protein that is found in heart &amp; skeletal muscle tissue. When the muscles are damaged, myoglobin is released into the bloodstream and filtered by the kidneys.  Large amounts of myoglobin can cause kidney damage. 

Because myoglobin is found in both cardiac and skeletal muscle tissue, it has a low specificity for myocardial infarctions. Very high concentrations of myoglobin may increase the risk of acute renal failure. Because myoglobin is excreted in the urine and is nephrotoxic, urine output should frequently be monitored.</string>

		<key>summary</key>
		<string>The clotting cascade is a very complicated process that involves numerous coagulation factors (active proenzymes) produced primarily by the liver. The coagulation study looks at the amount of the function of coagulation proteins that are circulating in the bloodstream which are essential for clot formation. People with bleeding disorders have a disruption in the clotting cascade. When the factors are low, it can cause clotting to fail which lead to unexplained bleeding. </string>

				<key>longdescription</key>
				<string>The activated clotting time (ACT) is a test used at the bedside or in the OR used to document neutralization of high-dose unfractionated (standard) heparin therapy (especially after cardiac surgery, hemodialysis, and bypass). Factors that can affect the ACT is hemodilution, hypothermia, platelet function.

High-dose heparin during these procedures prevents clot formation but leaves the body in a fragile dynamic offset between clotting and bleeding. At this level of anticoagulation, the PTT is no longer clinically useful as a monitoring tool, so the ACT is used. 

The ACT has several advantages over the PTT. 1) It&apos;s more accurate at higher doses of heparin therapy because the aPTT is not measurable at these ranges. 2) Can be performed at the bedside and is a less expensive test.

				<string>The D-Dimer is a fibrin split product (a small protein that&apos;s in the blood after a clot is degraded by fibrinolysis) used to evaluate suspected DVT and PE.
Released when there&apos;s a fibrinolytic breakdown of fibrin. 

Fibrinolysis is mediated by plasmin, which degrades fibrin clots into D-dimers and fibrin degradation products (FDP). Cancer patients often have positive D-dimers and FDP, usually representing low-grade, chronic DIC.  Serial D-dimers may be used to monitor thromboembolisms.</string>

It&apos;s the standard to guide coumadin therapy and provides a more standardized measure against a standard reagent.  It&apos;s a calculation that is used to adjust to the reagents that used during a  prothrombin time test. Because the reagents in different laboratories may vary, the following formula is commonly used.  
INR = (PT of the patient/PT – control) ^ISI. 
ISI is the (International Sensitivity Index). INR is not affected by heparin.</string>

				<string>The prothrombin time (PT)  is a measure of the extrinsic pathways which include the following factors: II, V, VII, X; Used to monitor patients who are taking oral anticoagulants.  When the PT is prolonged, it means that the blood is taking too long to clot. The PT is often compared to the PTT to determine which disorder may be present. For example:

PT- Prolonged &amp; PTT - Normal: 
Liver disease, vitamin K deficiency, factor VII deficiency, early disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC),  coumadin therapy.

PT- Normal &amp; PTT - Prolonged: 
Factor VIII, IX, XI deficiency, or XII, von Willebrand disease, autoantibodies against specific clotting factors (e.g., factor IX).
 
PT- Prolonged &amp; PTT - Prolonged: 
Factor I, II, V or X deficiency, severe liver disease, DIC, coumadin overdose.

PT- Normal &amp; PTT - Normal/ Slightly Prolonged: 
Further testing may be required to diagnose von Willebrand disease and other clotting factors because these values could also reflect normal hemostasis or mild coag deficiencies.</string>

				<string>Calcium is most abundant mineral in the body and is essential for the functional integrity of the nervous and muscular systems. Ca+ homeostasis is maintained by the parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and Calcitonin. It is necessary for cardiac function, blood coagulation, maintains cell membrane and capillary permeability. Also, stabilizes myocardial membranes associated with hyperkalemia. Approximate one half the total calcium in the blood exists in its free (ionized) form, the other half is protein-bound (mostly with albumin). When measuring the serum calcium level, we measure the protein bound and ionized form collectively.  Serum calcium levels parallel the albumin. When albumin is low, so will the serum calcium.  Note that the total serum calcium level will decrease roughly 0.8mg for every 1-g decrease in the serum albumin level. An advantage of testing only the ionized form is that it is unaffected by changes in serum albumin levels.</string>

When the liver is unable to break down the ammonia, ammonia levels rise which can help diagnose liver diseases, hepatic encephalopathy, and Reyes syndrome. Moreover, when portal blood flow to the liver is modified (e.g., in portal hypertension), ammonia cannot reach the liver to be catabolized, thus blood ammonia rises.</string>

GGTP is the most sensitive liver enzyme in detecting cholecystitis, biliary obstructions, or cholangitis. The highest concentrations are typically found in the biliary tract and liver. However, small amounts can also be located in the heart, brain, prostate, intestines, spleen, and kidneys. This enzyme is used in conjunction with ALP to help detect liver diseases and bile duct injuries.  GGTP is also useful in recognizing chronic alcohol ingestion as enzyme levels are elevated in approximately 75% of alcoholics. In general, elevated levels of Gamma-Glutamyl transferase can indicate liver damage but is not specific.</string>

				<string>Amylase</string>
				<key>longdescription</key>
				<string>Amylase is used to help diagnose pancreatic disorders, such as pancreatitis. Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down complex carbohydrates, i.e.( starch ) into sugar. There are two types of amylase, alpha, and beta. Alpha is found in the saliva, and beta amylase is located in the pancreas. Amylase is typically secreted from the pancreatic acinar cell into the pancreatic duct and then into the duodenum. Once in the intestines, amylase is broken down into simple sugars. 

When there is damage to the acinar cells (as in pancreatitis) or pancreatic obstructions, there is an overflow of amylase into the intra-pancreatic lymph system and peritoneum. Blood vessels that drain the peritoneum will then pick up the excess amylase thus raising the serum amylase level usually within 12 hours of onset. Typically, serum amylase levels will return to normal, considering that the kidney function is reasonable since the kidneys clear amylase.</string>

		<string>Lipid panels are performed to monitor responses to medication and therapy, and also identify a person&apos;s risk for cardiac disease. Cholesterol is synthesized by the liver and transported in the circulation in association with lipoproteins which are an accurate predictor of cardiac disease. The low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) have the highest concentration of cholesterol. 

Cholesterol is essential to every cell; it is a precursor to adrenal steroids, gonadal steroids, and bile salts and is insoluble in water. Elevated cholesterol, particularly LDL cholesterol, is associated with accelerated atherogenesis. In contrast, raised high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is protective.</string>

Protein is one of the most sensitive indicators within the Central Nervous System. Protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid can also be used to differentiate between bacterial and viral meningitis as well. In bacterial infections (such as bacterial meningitis, and TB meningitis) the protein will be substantially elevated.  

This is because these diseases can alter the permeability of the blood-brain barrier allowing for the protein to leak into the cerebral spinal fluid. However, there may be mild elevations with viral meningitis as well. Protein levels will also be raised in different neurological disorders, inflammation processes, or interruption of the blood-brain barrier.</string>

				<string>Urine Bilirubin</string>
				<key>longdescription</key>
				<string>Bilirubin originally is acquired from the metabolism of hemoglobin. Typically, it&apos;s excreted via the bile ducts into the bowels. In the bowels, bacteria transform bilirubin into urobilinogen. Conjugated (direct) bilirubin is water soluble and is excreted in the urine, and typically, only trace amounts can be detected in urine. Unconjugated bilirubin caused by prehepatic jaundice will not be excreted in the urine because it is not water soluble.

High urinary bilirubin occurs in patients with obstructive jaundice or jaundice due to hepatocellular disease or injury. However, urine bilirubin is nearly indifferent to detecting liver diseases.</string>

				<string>Urine Ketones</string>
				<key>longdescription</key>
				<string>Ketones are a by-product of fatty acid breakdown in the liver not typically found in the body. Ketones are three water-soluble compounds (acetone, acetoacetate, &amp;  beta-hydroxybutyrate ) that are used as energy in the heart and the brain. When the body does not produce enough sugar carbohydrates, there will be an increasing amount of ketones in the body. Ketone bodies in the urine indicate that cellular metabolism is dependent upon fatty acids rather than glucose for energy. Patients who are hyperglycemic and have poorly controlled diabetes will produce ketones from fatty acid catabolism. These ketones subsequently spill into the urine when they reach high levels.</string>

				<string>The kidneys play a significant part in regulating acid-base balance in the body. Therefore acidic / basic foods ingested throughout the day, medications and renal tubular function can directly affect the pH of the urine. 

Similarly, substances that are dissolved in the urine can form crystals. These crystals develop into kidney stones or &quot;calculi.&quot; These calculi can be modified by diet and medications.  Urine pH &lt; 6.0 can help reduce the ability of renal calculi formation. Conversely, a pH &gt; 6.0 can reduce the incidence of uric acid stones. </string>

				<key>longdescription</key>
				<string>Protein found in urine is usually in small excess. This is why protein is considered a sensitive indicator of renal and glomerular function. The kidneys do an exceptional job at filtering protein, nevertheless, when protein levels exceed these values it&apos;s concerning for renal dysfunction. 

Proteinuria (usually albumin) is probably the most important indicator of renal disease. Protein levels between 100 and 300 mg/dL maybe from microalbuminuria, which usually stems from diabetes,  is an early sign of kidney disease. Higher levels (over 300 mg/dL) indicate serious renal dysfunction. In pregnancy, the presence of urine protein is routinely checked. Protein present in pregnancy is an indicator of preeclampsia.</string>
